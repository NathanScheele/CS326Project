# Daniel Obichie's information

Hello. My name's Daniel. Programming languages I know are majorly 
Java, some C. As far as web dev, I know pretty much HTML, CSS, and JS as far as this class has taught. For database experience, I have tampered with MongoDB in HackUMass by setting it up using MongoDB Atlas online a making a database to host mock data for my group's project. I have also helped setup accounts for my group members to access it and also using either shell or Compass to add data to the database. But I have not tampered yet with connecting it with backend server.

 

Some final project ideas include combining express, Node.js, and MongoDB to set up a mock data set with a front end involving inputting a student ID and having a retrieval of that's students statistics such as how well they're doing in the class in general, their paper usage, their progress toward graduation.
