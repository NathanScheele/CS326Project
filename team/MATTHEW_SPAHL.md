#Matthew Spahl's Information

My name is Matt, and I have experience programming in Java, C, C++, C#, Python, and Javascript, as well as with using HTML and CSS. I took a course in HTML and CSS in high school, so I have more experience with front-end development. I have also viewed tutorials on Bootstrap. Additionally, I have experience with most aspects of game development (Unity), 3d modelling (Blender), animation, and Photoshop/Gimp. I am currently taking CS 383 and we are reaching machine learning now. My areas of interest include game development, AI, world history, government, and economics.
